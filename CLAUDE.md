# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a fintech application for consigned loans (empr√©stimo consignado) built for the Credifit technical challenge. The system allows employees from partner companies to request loans with automatic approval based on predefined business rules.

**Architecture**: Full-stack application with separate backend and frontend
- **Backend**: NestJS REST API with SQLite database (Prisma ORM)
- **Frontend**: React application with React Router v7 and TailwindCSS

## Common Commands

### Backend (NestJS)
```bash
cd backend
npm install                # Install dependencies
npm run start:dev          # Start development server (port 3000)
npm run build              # Build for production
npm run start:prod         # Start production server
npm run test               # Run unit tests
npm run test:e2e           # Run e2e tests
npm run test:cov           # Run tests with coverage
npm run lint               # Run ESLint
npm run format             # Format code with Prettier
```

### Frontend (React Router v7)
```bash
cd frontend
npm install                # Install dependencies
npm run dev                # Start development server
npm run build              # Build for production
npm run start              # Start production server
npm run typecheck          # Run TypeScript type checking
```

## Database

- **Database**: SQLite with Prisma ORM
- **Location**: `backend/databese/dev.db`
- **Schema**: `backend/prisma/schema.prisma`
- **Migration commands**: Run from backend directory
  ```bash
  npx prisma migrate dev     # Create and apply migration
  npx prisma generate        # Generate Prisma client
  npx prisma studio          # Open Prisma Studio
  ```

## Core Business Logic

### Data Models
- **Company**: Partner companies with employees
- **Employee**: Users who can request loans
- **Loan**: Loan requests with automatic approval system

### Key Business Rules
- Maximum consignable margin: 35% of employee salary
- Loan approval based on credit score and salary
- Installment options: 1 to 4 times
- Loan statuses: PENDING, PROCESSING, PAID, REJECTED

## Authentication System

- **JWT-based authentication** for both companies and employees
- **Dual user types**: "employee" and "company"
- **Auth context**: `frontend/app/context/auth/AuthContext.tsx`
- **Protected routes**: Authentication required for main application areas
- **API service**: Centralized in `frontend/app/api/index.ts`

## API Structure

Backend follows NestJS modular architecture:
- **Auth Module**: Login/logout for companies and employees
- **Company Module**: Company management
- **Employee Module**: Employee management  
- **Loan Module**: Loan requests and management
- **Analysis Module**: Loan approval analysis
- **Prisma Module**: Database service

## Frontend Architecture

React Router v7 application with:
- **Route configuration**: `frontend/app/routes.ts`
- **Layout system**: Main layout with header/navigation
- **Context providers**: Auth context for state management
- **API integration**: Axios-based API client
- **Form handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS with custom CSS

### Key Components
- **AuthContext**: Global authentication state management
- **ProtectedRoute/PublicRoute**: Route guards
- **Home components**: Company and Employee dashboards
- **Loan components**: Credit request flow in `frontend/app/component/credito/`

## Development Workflow

1. **Backend first**: Start backend server before frontend
2. **Database**: Ensure SQLite database exists and migrations are applied
3. **Testing**: Run tests before committing changes
4. **Linting**: Both backend and frontend have ESLint configured
5. **Type checking**: Frontend has TypeScript strict mode enabled
